# Script templates

## Install

`install_template.sh` is a small bash script to create very simple installers
for other scripts.

It allows you to configure which script(s) should be installed and the systemd
services that depend on those.

It also gives the user the posibility to inmediately start or enable all 
services right after installing them.
