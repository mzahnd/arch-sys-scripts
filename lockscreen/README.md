# xsecurelock Launcher

Lock the desktop with [xsecurelock](https://github.com/google/xsecurelock)
(through `xset`) and play a collection of background videos.

Proper configuration of `lock-xsecurelock.sh` should be performed as it has 
some custom paths set. Note that the default configuration of this script uses
the `backlight` script in this same repository.

## Usage: 

Run `xss-lock.sh` to properly configure and start `xset`. Then you can use 
`xset s activate` whenever the screen should be locked.
