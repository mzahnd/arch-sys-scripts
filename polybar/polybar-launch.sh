# SYNOPSIS
#   script.sh [OPTIONS]
# OPTIONS
#       force   Run even if XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP is not i3
#       debug   Run in debug mode (does not deamonize)

# ====== EDITABLE SECTION ======

# Bars. At least one bar should be set here.
# Index are accessed are as `xrandr --listmonitors` says, so if the previous 
# command outputs something like this:
# 0: +*eDP1 ...
# 1: +HDMI1 ...
# The first bar (index 0) will be started in eDP1, and the second one in HDMI1.
readonly BARS=('bar_main' 'bar_secondary')

# Relative to user's home.
